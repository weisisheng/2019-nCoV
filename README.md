# 2019-nCoV
This goal of this project is to collect information and analyse trends of statistics of Novel Coronavirus originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, P.R. China in 2019.

The original code source is on github project [2019-nCoV](https://github.com/yitao94/2019-nCoV) with [MIT license](https://github.com/yitao94/2019-nCoV/blob/master/LICENSE).

## About me
The author is a witness and survivor of the 2003 SARScov outbreak in Beijing City during his elementary school. From his memory, one of the mistakes from that disaster is the so-called "concealed declaration of infected and death cases" from the government, which raised quite a lot of panic in the public. He hopes governments and related departments can draw lessons from that eqidemic history, and use more professional, strict, powerful attitude from the very beginning of today's affair. 

May God bless human beings, without boundaries of countries, race, and/or beliefs.

## Note
The news and statical figures are collected from local (P.R. China) and global media. The author tries to keep his objectivity and gives no hints or clues about which data source is more/less accurate. 

> Eliminating rumors, and ignorance panic shares same importance of clarifing open information in time.
